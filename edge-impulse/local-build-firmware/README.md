Each of these main folders might compile

uploading to your board might be slightly different.

ETA computer use the Serial-upload-binary folder and replace the .bin file with your newly generated .bin file.
Silicon Labs, use there simplicity studion to upload the .bin file. (Should be easy I have not sone it.)
C++ or embed  and Zephyr you will have to figure out how to upload to your board
I have not yet figured out how to do the Nordic boards. Although this Gitpod was originally made to compile nordic boards, 
so probably some information about that somewhere on this Gitpod.
