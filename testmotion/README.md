txt files have the features info for testing.



ei-paint-brush-01-v2.zip   96x96 color. Data to big to compile

ei-paint-brush-01-v3.zip   48x48 color
ei-paint-brush-01-v4.zip   120x120 GRAYSCALE


So this is a test of downloading an EdgeImpulse c++ general file which compiled with EON on it, but did not make the flash .bin file for easy edge uploading.

I also tested an ETA compilation which would not work with EON and I used the ful float model, but it worked and created the bin file that could be uploaded using the easy edge impulse uploader

Testing it also worked running the following code. Note features was installed as per the instructions at 

```
edge-impulse-run-impulse --raw

```
